# Axial Compressive Strength Calculator (ACSC)

A computational framework for analyzing fiber-reinforced composite materials through 3D imaging. The system processes volumetric image data to extract fiber orientation fields, then calculates axial compressive strength using micromechanical models that account for fiber misalignment effects.
